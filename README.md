# Pascal-collisions
This is a small program that given 2 coordinates and vectors display two circles, and with the vectors given it shows if they collision or not
</br></br></br>
Compilation (I used free pascal compilator, but any Pascal compilator should work):</br>
fpc simulador.pas
</br></br></br>
Execution:</br>
linux: sudo ./simulador
</br>
windows: simulador
</br> Aclaration: Although it does run in windows, for some reason in windows it has 0.2 fps while in linus 30 fps

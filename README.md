# Pascal-collisions
This is a small program that given 2 coordinates and vectors display two circles, and with the vectors given it shows if they collision or not

Compilation (I used free pascal compilator, but any Pascal compilator should work):
fpc simulador.pas

Execution:
linux: ./simulador
</br>
windows: simulador
